# Current reality

**Warning:** this is a volatile navigation page. Re-check the repository before relying on it for implementation decisions.

## Verified repository baseline

At the verification ref (`747c528b67d234d697624929ccbcc7098261ed54` on `integracion/v1`), the repository identifies DEKOPEN as:

- a pure deterministic engine under `engine/`;
- Django modular monolith under `backend/`;
- React + TypeScript + Vite under `frontend/`;
- Supabase/Postgres migrations and RLS under `supabase/`;
- product/engineering specifications under `docs/`.

Hard invariants documented by the repo include:

- Decimal for millimetres/money;
- no LLM/free-text numeric engineering truth;
- 0.00 mm deterministic golden behavior;
- tenant `org_id` + RLS;
- immutable issued artifacts/history;
- explicit human action for externally consequential events.

## Product direction already present in the repo

`docs/PRODUCT.md` already encodes:

- unified product-centered workspace;
- compositional assemblies/modules/couplings;
- bow/bay as templates over composition rather than enum branches;
- direct manipulation + typed operations + undo/redo;
- AI using the same typed operations as UI;
- workshop-language validation;
- Oknosoft/WindowBuilder as a domain reference.

## P00 foundation state

P00 is complete across dekopen PR #1 (squash 747c528b; a partial first landing on framedex PR #114 carried over): it adds the v1 integration foundation:

- `integracion/v1` exists as the queue integration branch.
- `docs/design/CONSTITUCION.md` is the mandatory design constitution copied from the queue.
- `docs/decisions/valores-por-defecto.md` records constitution defaults for later implementation.
- `docs/operations/ACTIVACION.md` indexes deferred external integrations without secret values.
- `frontend/scripts/ux-capture/` provides a Playwright capture harness with text/presentation detectors and unit coverage.
- The production route table hides `/projects/demo/positions/g1/edit` behind the same dev-only mechanism as `/benchmark`.
- `scripts/dev_fixture.py` now seeds more realistic DEMO fixture identity, clients and project volume while preserving `DEMO_60` as synthetic reference data.

Verification: dekopen PR #1 passed all required GitHub checks (Lint & Typecheck, Test Suite, Frontend Build, Database Gate) and was verified end-to-end on the live local stack — the earlier caveat (login-only smoke baseline, portal tokens unavailable) is resolved: the committed baseline now covers 270 authenticated captures across 38 routes and the fixture carries all 5 portal token states.

## Recent branch/PR caution

The repository has accumulated many historical branches and stacked agent changes.

Do not assume “latest PR number = complete product”.

As of the latest observed metadata around 2026-09-27/28, PRs including #107 and #109 were open; their relevance/current CI must be checked again before use.

Historical audit notes reported periods where:

- commercial-workspace work existed on a large advanced branch;
- OpenAPI/client drift and catalog authorization defects blocked CI;
- documentation/testing PRs were not substitutes for missing product stabilization.

Treat these as leads for inspection, not timeless truth.

## Current-state procedure

Before changing a capability:

1. locate current implementation on the target ref;
2. inspect related migrations and generated API types;
3. inspect recent PRs/branches that may supersede main;
4. run focused tests;
5. use the real UI if behavior/UX is involved;
6. then update this page if a durable current-state fact materially changed.

A fuller capability-by-capability reality map should be added only after a fresh systematic repository + running-product audit.
